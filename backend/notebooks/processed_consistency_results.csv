The products listed, such as the Coral Dev Board and ConnectCore SBC, offer a range of features but fall short in terms of memory capacity, with most offering around 1GB of RAM. The SBCAPL V from Kontron does include USB 3.0 ports, which is a plus, but again, the memory capacity doesn't reach the 128GB mark. It seems the search might need to be broadened or adjusted to find the perfect match.","[{""productId"":""102110260"",""name"":""CORAL DEV"",""manufacturer"":""GOOGLE"",""formFactor"":""SBC"",""evaluationOrCommercialization"":""Evaluation"",""processorArchitecture"":""ARM"",""processorCoreCount"":""4"",""processorManufacturer"":""NXP"",""processorTdp"":null,""memory"":""1.0GB LPDDR4"",""onboardStorage"":""8 GB EMMC"",""inputVoltage"":""5.0V"",""ioCount"":[],""wireless"":[""BLUETOOTH 4"",""WI-FI 5""],""operatingSystemBsp"":[""DEBIAN""],""operatingTemperatureMax"":null,""operatingTemperatureMin"":null,""certifications"":[""RCM"",""OTHER"",""VCCI"",""CE"",""FCC"",""KC"",""BSMI""],""price"":null,""stockAvailability"":null},{""productId"":""CC-SB-WMX-KK8D"",""name"":""CONNECTCORE SBC"",""manufacturer"":""DIGI INTERNATIONAL"",""formFactor"":""SBC"",""evaluationOrCommercialization"":""Commercial"",""processorArchitecture"":""ARM"",""processorCoreCount"":""4"",""processorManufacturer"":""NXP"",""processorTdp"":null,""memory"":""1.0GB DDR3"",""onboardStorage"":""8 GB EMMC"",""inputVoltage"":""5.0V"",""ioCount"":[""USB""],""wireless"":[""WI-FI 5"",""BLUETOOTH""],""operatingSystemBsp"":[""ANDROID"",""YOCTO LINUX""],""operatingTemperatureMax"":""85°C"",""operatingTemperatureMin"":""-40°C"",""certifications"":[""FCC CLASS B"",""OTHER"",""VCCI""],""price"":null,""stockAvailability"":null},{""productId"":""43012-0000-18-4"",""name"":""SBCAPL V"",""manufacturer"":""KONTRON"",""formFactor"":""SBC"",""evaluationOrCommercialization"":""Commercial"",""processorArchitecture"":""X86"",""processorCoreCount"":""4"",""processorManufacturer"":""INTEL"",""processorTdp"":""6.0W"",""memory"":""DDR3L"",""onboardStorage"":""MICROSD CAGE"",""inputVoltage"":""12.0V"",""ioCount"":[""USB 3.0""],""wireless"":[""OTHER""],""operatingSystemBsp"":[""LINUX"",""WINDOWS""],""operatingTemperatureMax"":""85°C"",""operatingTemperatureMin"":""-40°C"",""certifications"":[""CE"",""FCC CLASS B""],""price"":null,""stockAvailability"":null},{""productId"":""PCA-6012G2-00A1E"",""name"":""PCA"",""manufacturer"":""ADVANTECH"",""formFactor"":""SBC"",""evaluationOrCommercialization"":""Commercial"",""processorArchitecture"":""X86"",""processorCoreCount"":""2"",""processorManufacturer"":""INTEL"",""processorTdp"":""LOW POWER"",""memory"":""UNKNOWN DDR3 800 MHZ, UP TO 4 GB"",""onboardStorage"":""ONE SATA HDD"",""inputVoltage"":""5.0V"",""ioCount"":[""GPIO"",""USB"",""OTHER"",""SERIAL""],""wireless"":[""OTHER"",""WI-FI"",""BLUETOOTH""],""operatingSystemBsp"":[""OTHER""],""operatingTemperatureMax"":""60°C"",""operatingTemperatureMin"":""0°C"",""certifications"":[""CE"",""FCC""],""price"":null,""stockAvailability"":null},{""productId"":""SRI3710S00D04GE008Q00CH"",""name"":""SOLIDPC Q"",""manufacturer"":""SOLIDRUN"",""formFactor"":""SBC"",""evaluationOrCommercialization"":""Commercial"",""processorArchitecture"":""X86"",""processorCoreCount"":""4"",""processorManufacturer"":""INTEL"",""processorTdp"":null,""memory"":""0-8.0GB DDR3"",""onboardStorage"":""EMMC, M.2 SSD CONNECTOR"",""inputVoltage"":""12.0V"",""ioCount"":[""USB"",""SERIAL"",""DISPLAY""],""wireless"":[""WI-FI"",""BLUETOOTH""],""operatingSystemBsp"":[""LINUX"",""ANDROID"",""WINDOWS""],""operatingTemperatureMax"":""70°C"",""operatingTemperatureMin"":""0°C"",""certifications"":[],""price"":null,""stockAvailability"":null}]","The search results provided do not include any SBCs with 128GB or more memory.
