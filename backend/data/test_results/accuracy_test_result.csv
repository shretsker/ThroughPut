Let's dive into what we found! The AGS series stands out with its 64GB industrial-grade mSATA SSD, making it a robust choice for industrial server applications. It features dual Intel Xeon processors and extensive I/O options, ensuring high performance and reliability. Another great option is the Bengal SBC, which supports mSATA storage and is built to withstand harsh environments, thanks to its Intel Atom processors and wide operating temperature range. While the Tomcat and VLCOMM products are also MIL-STD-810 certified, they don't feature M.2 or mSATA storage options. The TREK, although certified, offers dual external HDD/SSD trays instead. These products are all designed to endure tough conditions, but the AGS and Bengal are your best bets for mSATA storage.","[{""productId"":""VL-EPM-16F"",""name"":""TOMCAT"",""manufacturer"":""VERSALOGIC"",""formFactor"":""PCPLUS"",""evaluationOrCommercialization"":""Commercial"",""processorArchitecture"":""ARM"",""processorCoreCount"":""8"",""processorManufacturer"":""DMP"",""processorTdp"":null,""memory"":""0.5GB DDR2"",""onboardStorage"":""COMPACTFLASH SOCKET TYPE II"",""inputVoltage"":""5.0V"",""ioCount"":[""USB"",""OTHER"",""SERIAL""],""wireless"":[""CELLULAR"",""WI-FI"",""BLUETOOTH""],""operatingSystemBsp"":[""QNX"",""WINDOWS"",""LINUX"",""VXWORKS"",""WINDOWS EMBEDDED""],""operatingTemperatureMax"":""85°C"",""operatingTemperatureMin"":""-40°C"",""certifications"":[""MIL-STD-810"",""ROHS""],""price"":null,""stockAvailability"":null},{""productId"":""TREK-688-00A0E"",""name"":""TREK"",""manufacturer"":""ADVANTECH"",""formFactor"":""IN-VEHICLE COMPUTING BOX"",""evaluationOrCommercialization"":""Commercial"",""processorArchitecture"":""X86"",""processorCoreCount"":""2"",""processorManufacturer"":""INTEL"",""processorTdp"":null,""memory"":""4.0GB"",""onboardStorage"":""DUAL EXTERNAL HDD/SSD TRAY"",""inputVoltage"":""24.0V"",""ioCount"":[""OTHER"",""AUDIO"",""ETHERNET""],""wireless"":[""WI-FI"",""BLUETOOTH"",""4G/LTE""],""operatingSystemBsp"":[""WINDOWS""],""operatingTemperatureMax"":""70°C"",""operatingTemperatureMin"":""-30°C"",""certifications"":[""MIL-STD-810"",""ISO""],""price"":null,""stockAvailability"":null},{""productId"":""AGS-923I-R18A1E"",""name"":""AGS"",""manufacturer"":""ADVANTECH"",""formFactor"":""PROPRIETARY"",""evaluationOrCommercialization"":""Commercial"",""processorArchitecture"":""X86"",""processorCoreCount"":""8"",""processorManufacturer"":""INTEL"",""processorTdp"":""15.0W-25.0W"",""memory"":""0-768.0GB DDR4"",""onboardStorage"":""64.0GB MLC INDUSTRIAL-GRADE MSATA SSD"",""inputVoltage"":""9.0V"",""ioCount"":[""USB""],""wireless"":[""WI-FI""],""operatingSystemBsp"":[""LINUX"",""WINDOWS""],""operatingTemperatureMax"":""70°C"",""operatingTemperatureMin"":""-40°C"",""certifications"":[""MIL-STD-810""],""price"":null,""stockAvailability"":null},{""productId"":""VL-COMM-26EAK"",""name"":""VLCOMM"",""manufacturer"":""VERSALOGIC"",""formFactor"":""COM EXPRESS"",""evaluationOrCommercialization"":""Commercial"",""processorArchitecture"":""X86"",""processorCoreCount"":""4"",""processorManufacturer"":""INTEL"",""processorTdp"":null,""memory"":""0-8.0GB SOLDERED-ON"",""onboardStorage"":""MICROSD SOCKET"",""inputVoltage"":""5.0V"",""ioCount"":[""USB"",""SERIAL"",""SATA"",""OTHER"",""OTHER_BUS"",""PCIE""],""wireless"":[],""operatingSystemBsp"":[""LINUX"",""VXWORKS"",""WINDOWS EMBEDDED"",""WINDOWS""],""operatingTemperatureMax"":""85°C"",""operatingTemperatureMin"":""-40°C"",""certifications"":[""MIL-STD-810"",""ROHS""],""price"":null,""stockAvailability"":null},{""productId"":""VL-EPME-30EAP"",""name"":""BENGAL"",""manufacturer"":""VERSALOGIC"",""formFactor"":""PC"",""evaluationOrCommercialization"":""Commercial"",""processorArchitecture"":""X86"",""processorCoreCount"":""1"",""processorManufacturer"":""INTEL"",""processorTdp"":null,""memory"":""0-8.0GB GB"",""onboardStorage"":""MSATA SUPPORT"",""inputVoltage"":""5.0V"",""ioCount"":[""USB"",""SATA"",""OTHER"",""ETHERNET""],""wireless"":[""WI-FI""],""operatingSystemBsp"":[""QNX"",""WINDOWS"",""LINUX"",""VXWORKS"",""WINDOWS EMBEDDED""],""operatingTemperatureMax"":""85°C"",""operatingTemperatureMin"":""-40°C"",""certifications"":[""MIL-STD-810""],""price"":null,""stockAvailability"":null}]","The AGS and Bengal products directly meet the user's criteria with mSATA storage and MIL-STD-810 certification.
