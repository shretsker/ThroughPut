The CPU's effective operating speed can be throttled back from normal performance to decrease the board's overall power draw. The throttling can be controlled via a CMOS startup option and can also be enabled, disabled, or changed via a simple write to an I/O port. The VSBC is fully compatible with a wide selection of popular x86 operating systems, including Windows and Real-Time Operating Systems. Each board is subjected to environmental stress screening and complete functional testing, and is backed by VersaLogic Corp's service and support. Both hardware and software BIOS customization are available in quantities as low as 100 pieces.""}"
